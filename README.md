### This repository includes all code and source files for the Bipartisan Policy Center's research on scheduling conflicts in Congress.
The Jupyter Notebook "Scheduling - Conflicts Data Pull V2" includes all code for collecting hearing data from docs.house.gov and House of Representatives member committee assignments from clerk.house.gov. It also includes code which uses these collected data points to find all scheduling conflicts in members of Congress' committee schedules.

Note: Due rate limiters on government websites, the code may take a few hours to run - as it is collected data directly from house.gov when run.

To speed up the process, the Jupyter Notebook "Scheduling - Aggregating Results" relies on pre-loaded csv's that were initially created from the "Scheduling - Conflicts Data Pull V2" notebook.
